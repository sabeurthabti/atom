Follow [these\ninstructions](http://flowtype.org/docs/getting-started.html) to install Flow\nif you do not already have it. Unfortunately Flow currently has [no Windows\nsupport](https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/6), so this package will not\nwork on Windows.\n\nThis is what you need to do to get Flow working on your system:\n\n* Install Flow.\n* Make sure `flow` is on your `$PATH`, or specify the path to the `flow` binary in\n  the settings for this package.\n* Create a `.flowconfig` file in the root of your project (this can be empty).\n* Add `/* @flow */` to the top of JavaScript files that you want checked.\n\nVisit the [Flow page](http://flowtype.org/) for more detailed instructions.\n\n# Examples\n\nThis package shows Flow errors inline:\n\n![Inline Errors](./images/FlowInlineError.gif)\n\nThis package also integrates click to symbol with Flow, so a `cmd-click` on a\nsymbol will jump to its definition.\n\n![Click to Symbol](./images/FlowClickDefine.gif)\n\nThere is also support for inline autocomplete of JavaScript functions and\nmethods.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-flow/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-flow","_id":"nuclide-flow@0.0.21","_shasum":"ec705d19d24dd2a26fb06d182329ab2afd18574c","_resolved":"file:../d-115524-4599-1fxhdvi/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115524-4599-1fxhdvi/package.tgz"}
